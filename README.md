# Dürer Witch Engravings: Annotated Comparative Analysis

This repository hosts a digital exhibition and analysis of Albrecht Dürer's witch engravings, focusing on two key works:

1. **"The Four Witches"** (1497)
2. **"Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat"** (c. 1500)

## Project Objective

The project aims to compare these engravings through two distinct lenses:
- **Artistic Analysis**: Examination of classical motifs, composition, line work, and shadow.
- **Historical Context**: Exploration of theological debates, social fears, and the role of the printing press in disseminating witch imagery.

## Repository Structure

- `images/` – Contains public‑domain copies of the engravings (with source references).
- `artistic_notes.md` – Detailed analysis of artistic techniques and classical references.
- `context_notes.md` – Summary of historical, theological, and social context.
- `README.md` – This overview.

## How to Use

1. Browse the `images` folder to view the engravings.
2. Read the analytical notes in the markdown files.
3. Review the GitHub Issues that frame the research questions.
4. Examine the Pull Requests that integrate the separate analyses.
